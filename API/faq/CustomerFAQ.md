# Customer FAQ


## Order not confirmed or expired or waiting for blockchain
If you have paid with cryptocurrencies (e.g. Bitcoin BTC/ Ethereum ETH / USDT), you can see the txHash or txID and blockchain exploerer url from your platforms.
First check if the transaction is confirmed on blockchain. If it's confirmed, please check the amount is correct and the order is paid within the time window.

Blockchain ususally takes some time to confirm based on differet blockchain network. If your order cannot confirm after 60 minutes, or If the order is expired or you pay a different amount.

* txHash and blockchain exploerer url - this will show the exact amount and time you have paid.
* invoice id or url - this will show the amount you need to pay
